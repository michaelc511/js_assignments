      /*
        Local Storage
        Local Storage is a web storage option allowing websites to store data persistently in a user's browser. 
        With a typical storage limit of 5-10MB, it surpasses cookies in capacity, enabling developers to store 
        more complex or larger quantities of data. Data stored in Local Storage remains until explicitly cleared, 
        either by the user or through the web application's code. This makes it particularly useful for storing 
        user preferences, application state, and other data that should persist across sessions and browser restarts. 
        Unlike cookies, Local Storage data is not automatically sent to the server with every HTTP request, making it a 
        more efficient choice for data that does not need to be consistently shared with the server.

        Session Storage
        Session Storage is similar to Local Storage in terms of API and storage capacity but differs significantly 
        in lifespan and scope. Data stored in Session Storage is available for the duration of the page session, 
        which ends when the tab or browser window is closed. This makes Session Storage ideal for storing data 
        that should only be maintained during a single session and not persist beyond that, such as data related 
        to a single workflow or transaction in a web application. Each browser tab has its own isolated Session Storage,
        ensuring that data stored in one tab is not accessible from another, enhancing security and privacy.

        Cookies
        Cookies are a crucial component of web development, used primarily for session management, user tracking, 
        and storing small pieces of data (up to about 4KB) directly in the browser. Cookies are automatically sent with 
        every HTTP request to the domain that set them, making them useful for authenticating user sessions, maintaining 
        user preferences across visits, and tracking user behavior for analytics. However, due to their size limitation 
        and the performance impact of sending data with every request, cookies are less suitable for storing large amounts 
        of data. Additionally, security considerations must be taken into account when using cookies, as they can be 
        susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks if not properly secured.
